== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this load external javascript resources ? =

Yes, it does.
* For card payment we used [PayU Secure Form](https://developers.payu.com/en/card_tokenization.html#secureform) and for proper working it is necessary to load Secure Form JS SDK from the secure.payu.com domain. As a result, you do not need to have PCI DSS, PayU does it for you.
* For presenting minimal installment amount we used [Widget Installments](https://developers.payu.com/en/installments.html#installments_best_practices_mini) and plugin loads the script from the static.payu.com domain.
